## HTTP
In this tutorial, you'll add the following data persistence features with help from Angular's HttpClient.

1. The HeroService gets hero data with HTTP requests.
2. Users can add, edit, and delete heroes and save these changes over HTTP.
3. Users can search for heroes by name.


## Summary
You're at the end of your journey, and you've accomplished a lot.

* You added the necessary dependencies to use HTTP in the app.
* You refactored HeroService to load heroes from a web API.
* You extended HeroService to support post(), put(), and delete() methods.
* You updated the components to allow adding, editing, and deleting of heroes.
* You configured an in-memory web API.
* You learned how to use observables.
