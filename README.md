##Routing
There are new requirements for the Tour of Heroes app:

* Add a Dashboard view.
* Add the ability to navigate between the Heroes and Dashboard views.
* When users click a hero name in either view, navigate to a detail view of the selected hero.
* When users click a deep link in an email, open the detail view for a particular hero.
* When youâ€™re done, users will be able to navigate the app like this:
